## 100% packet-based - No entities created server-side
This library is 100% packet-based, meaning that no entities are created server-side.
This allows for a better performance and less lag on the server.
Packets are handled by [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/), which is a required dependency for this library.
